    <p>This is a demo of a prototype sound installation I began whilst studying at BIMM, <br />
        and have continued to work on post-graduation.<br />
        <br />
        
        The idea was to experiment with alternative ways of creating music, in order to <br />
        make the process of creation more accessible to people without any musical knowledge<br />
        <br />
        
        The 3 devices use sensors to convert human interactions into numerical values so<br />
        they can control and manipulate the sound and visuals being played.<br />
        <br />
        I used Arduinos to digitise the sensor interactions, and did all the sound design in<br />
        MaxMSP.
